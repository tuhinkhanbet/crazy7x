              period of time. Within 72 hours after results are posted, we will only reset/correct the results due to

              12.5. If a result cannot be validated by us, for instance if the feed broadcasting the event is
              interrupted (and cannot be verified by another source) then at our election, the wagers on that event will
              be deemed invalid and wagers refunded.<br><br>

              without prior written notice. We also reserve the right to adjust limits on individual Accounts as

              it cannot be changed. We do not take responsibility for missing or duplicate wagers made by the Customer
              and will not entertain discrepancy requests because a play is missing or duplicated. Customers may review
              their transactions in the My Account section of the site after each session to ensure all requested wagers
              were accepted.<br><br>

              the actual scheduled start time, the match will have no action and wagers will be refunded. The exception
              being any wager on whether a team/player advances in a tournament, or wins the tournament, will have
              action regardless of a suspended or postponed match.<br><br>

              12.10. If an event is posted by us with an incorrect date, all wagers have action based on the date
              announced by the governing body.<br><br>

              The above list of Prohibited Behaviour is not exhaustive and may be modified by us at any time or from
              time to time. We reserve the right to investigate and to take all such actions as we in our sole
              discretion deem appropriate or necessary under the circumstances, including without limitation deleting
              the Customer’s posting(s) from the Service and/or terminating their Account, and take any action against

              party.<br><br>

              <h5>21. Links to Other Websites</h5>
              The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not maintained by, or related to, us, and
              over which we have no control. Links to such websites are provided solely as a convenience to Customers,
              and are in no way investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by us. Links to such
              websites do not imply any endorsement by us of, and/or any affiliation with, the linked websites or their
              content or their owner(s). We have no control over or responsibility for the availability nor their
              accuracy, completeness, accessibility and usefulness. Accordingly when accessing such websites we
              recommend that you should take the usual precautions when visiting a new website including reviewing their
              privacy policy and terms of use.<br><br>

              <h5>22. Complaints</h5>
              22.1. If you have any concerns or questions regarding these Terms you should contact our Customer Service
              Department via the links on the Website and use your Registered Email Address in all communication with
              us.<br><br>

              22.2. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, WE TAKE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY WHEN
              RESPONDING TO ANY COMPLAINT THAT WE RECEIVED OR TOOK ACTION IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.<br><br>

              22.3. If a Customer is not satisfied with how a bet has been settled then the Customer should provide
              details of their grievance to our Customer Service Department. We shall use our reasonable endeavours to
              respond to queries of this nature within a few days (and in any event we intend to respond to all such
              queries within 28 days of receipt).<br><br>

              22.4. Disputes must be lodged within three (3) days from the date the wager in question has been decided.
              No claims will be honoured after this period. The Customer is solely responsible for their Account
              transactions.<br><br>

              22.5. In the event of a dispute arising between you and us our Customer Service Department will attempt to
              reach an agreed solution. Should our Customer Service Department be unable to reach an agreed solution
              with you, the matter will be escalated to our management.<br><br>

              22.6. Should all efforts to resolve a dispute to the Customer's satisfaction have failed, the Customer has
              the right to lodge a complaint with our licensing body Gaming Services Provider N.V.<br><br>

              <h5>23. Assignment</h5>
              Neither these Terms nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned by you without the
              prior written consent of us, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. We may, without your
              consent, assign all or any portion of our rights and obligations hereunder to any third party provided
              such third party is able to provide a service of substantially similar quality to the Service by posting
              written notice to this effect on the Service.<br><br>

              24. Severability
              In the event that any provision of these Terms is deemed by any competent authority to be unenforceable or
              invalid, the relevant provision shall be modified to allow it to be enforced in line with the intention of
              the original text to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The validity and enforceability of
              the remaining provisions of these Terms shall not be affected.<br><br>

              <h5>25. Breach of These Terms</h5>
              Without limiting our other remedies, we may suspend or terminate your Account and refuse to continue to
              provide you with the Service, in either case without giving you prior notice, if, in our reasonable
              opinion, you breach any material term of these Terms. Notice of any such action taken will, however, be
              promptly provided to you.<br><br>

              <h5>26. General Provisions</h5>
              26.1. Term of agreement. These Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you access or use the
              Service or are a Customer or visitor of the Website. These Terms will survive the termination of your
              Account for any reason.<br><br>

              26.2. Gender. Words importing the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa, words importing
              the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders and vice versa and words importing
              persons shall include individuals, partnerships, associations, trusts, unincorporated organisations and
              corporations.<br><br>

              26.3. Waiver. No waiver by us, whether by conduct or otherwise, of a breach or threatened breach by you of
              any term or condition of these Terms shall be effective against, or binding upon, us unless made in
              writing and duly signed by us, and, unless otherwise provided in the written waiver, shall be limited to
              the specific breach waived. The failure of us to enforce at any time any term or condition of these Terms
              shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision or of the right of us to enforce such provision at
              any other time.<br><br>

              26.4. Acknowledgement. By hereafter accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge having read,
              understood and agreed to each and every paragraph of these Terms. As a result, you hereby irrevocably
              waive any future argument, claim, demand or proceeding to the contrary of anything contained in these
              Terms.<br><br>

              26.5. Language. In the event of there being a discrepancy between the English language version of these
              rules and any other language version, the English language version will be deemed to be correct.<br><br>

              26.6. Governing Law. These Terms are governed by the law in force in Curaçao exclusively.<br><br>

              26.7. Entire agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to
              your access to and use of the Service, and supersedes all other prior agreements and communications,
              whether oral or written with respect to the subject matter hereof.<br><br>
