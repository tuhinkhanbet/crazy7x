            otherwise verifying the information you provide against third-party databases.<br><br>

            <h6>To monitor our website performance</h6>
            As detailed above, we use cookies and traffic analysis in order to improve the performance of our website

            right to privacy outweighs our legitimate business interests. However, as the activities involved are
            central to our business, if you wish to object further than managing your cookies this may mean you need to
            close your account.<br><br>

            chat or by emailing and we will provide you with a form to complete. The form is not compulsory but helps us
            to provide you with the information you are looking for in a timely manner. To ensure the security of your
            personal information, we will ask you for valid proof of identity and once we’ve received it we will provide
            our response within one month. If your request is unusually complex and likely to take longer than a month,
            we will let you know as soon as we can and tell you how long we think it will take, such request may also
            incur an administration cost.<br><br>

            You can request us to erase your personal data where there is no compelling reason to continue processing.
            This right only applies in certain circumstances; it is not a guaranteed or absolute right.<br><br>
